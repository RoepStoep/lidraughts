==================================

Lidraughts is a rewrite of [lichess/lila](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/) for draughts, supporting both 10x10 and 8x8 boards. It includes the 10x10 variants [Frisian draughts](https://lidraughts.org/variant/frisian), [Antidraughts](https://lidraughts.org/variant/antidraughts), [Frysk!](https://lidraughts.org/variant/frysk) and [Breakthrough](https://lidraughts.org/variant/breakthrough). The 8x8 variants are [Russian](https://lidraughts.org/variant/russian) and [Brazilian](https://lidraughts.org/variant/brazilian) draughts.

It features [live games](https://lidraughts.org/?any#hook),

Computer opposition and analysis is made possible by Fabien Letouzey's great engine [Scan 3.1](https://github.com/rhalbersma/scan) for all 10x10 draughts variants.

The UI is currently available in 23 languages, translated from English (GB and US) with a varying degree of completeness: Belarusian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, German, Greek, French, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, Polish, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese and Welsh; and out of respect for Frisian draughts of course also in Frisian!

Please help us translate Lidraughts [with Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lidraughts).

The source includes a draughts implementation of [scalachess](https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess/) in modules/draughts. The UI component [chessground](https://github.com/ornicar/chessground) is implemented for draughts as ui/draughtsground.
